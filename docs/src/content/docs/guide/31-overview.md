description: A general overview of the Ionic React Starter Kit
---

The Ionic React Starter Kit resulted from an opinionated effort to create a solid foundation for building hybrid apps with Ionic and React.

Over the past years I've been working on a project where I tried to cover all the features of a common full flagged application, which included:

- State Management
- Data Fetching
- Storage
- Forms Management and Validation
- Internationalization
- Routing
- Testing
- Documentation
- CI/CD

Plus, some native features like:
- Status Bar
- Network Status
- Notifications
- Application Icon and Splash Screen

I've also added some packages and components carefully chosen to provide useful features while minimizing bundle size and performance impact.

Some of these packages and components are:

- `underscorejs`
- `webfontloader`

I hope that with this starting point you can quickly get started with your next successful project and find the experience enjoyable and productive.
