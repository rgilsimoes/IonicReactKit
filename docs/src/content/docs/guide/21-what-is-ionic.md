title: 2.1 - What is Ionic Framework
description: A brief intro to the Ionic Framework.
---
[**Ionic Framework**](https://www.ionicframework.com) is an open-source UI toolkit for building high-quality, cross-platform applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It primarily focuses on the look and feel, and UI interactions of an app.

## Main reasons developers choose Ionic Framework

---

### Cross-Platform Development

Ionic allows you to build apps for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, desktop, and web) from a single codebase.

### Web Technologies

It utilizes familiar web technologies which makes it accessible for developers with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Component Rich

Ionic comes with a rich library of pre-designed components that mimic native behavior, either for **Android** or **iOS**, making it easy to create beautiful and functional user interfaces.

### Performance

Ionic apps can be just as performant as native apps, especially when paired with modern JavaScript frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue**.

### Community & Ecosystem

Ionic has a strong community, and there are many plugins and tools available to extend the functionality of Ionic apps.

### Capacitor

Ionic uses [Capacitor](https://www.capacitorjs.com) (a web-to-native wrapper) to access native device features such as the camera, GPS, sensors, and more, allowing for the development of hybrid applications.

:::tip[Overall]

Ionic Framework simplifies the process of app development with one codebase, customizable UI components, and accessibility to native device features.
