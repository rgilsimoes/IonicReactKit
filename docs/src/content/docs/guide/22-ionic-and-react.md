title: 2.2 - Ionic and React
description: What we get from using React with Ionic.
---
## History

Ionic started by using AngularJS as the core framework to support features
like Routing, State Management, and more.

React was introduced later in 2013 as an alternative to Angular and to demonstrate that Ionic's main purpose was to be a UI library and framework agnostic.

## Benefits of React

Using React with Ionic Framework brings several benefits for developers:

### Familiarity and Reusability

If you're already familiar with React, you can leverage your existing knowledge to build mobile applications, reusing your web development skills and potentially even code from web projects.

### Component-Based Architecture

React's component-based architecture works well with Ionic's UI components, making it straightforward to create complex interfaces with reusable, isolated components.

### Strong Ecosystem

React has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools that you can take advantage of in your Ionic project, including state management, routing, and more.

### Performance

React's efficient update and rendering system (Virtual DOM) helps in building high-performance apps with Ionic.

### Hot Reloading

React's hot reloading feature speeds up development by allowing you to see changes in real-time without losing the application state. Lately, Ionic has added support for Vite which increases the speed of development.

### TypeScript Support

Ionic embraced Typescript since the switch to Angular 2 and once React Types have been incorporated into React, it's now possible to use TypeScript in both React and Ionic.
By adopting TypeScript Ionic provides a more robust development experience with static type checking.

### Community and Support

There's a large community of developers building with React, which means plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries are available.

### Single Codebase

If your team already develops web apps with React, you can maintain a single codebase and support mobile apps as well. This makes it easier to reuse components, which simplifies development and can significantly reduce costs and time-to-market.

:::tip[Summary]
Using React with Ionic Framework can make mobile app development more efficient and accessible for developers who are already familiar with React, while also providing the benefits of a strong community, reusability, and performance.
