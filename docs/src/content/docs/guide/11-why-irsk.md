title: 1.1 - Why Ionic React Starter Kit
description: The reasons that lead me to build this kit.
---

I developed the Ionic React Starter Kit to provide a solid foundation for building hybrid apps with Ionic and React.

The following are the main reasons that led me to create this kit:

### Seamless Integration:
The kit seamlessly integrates Ionic Framework with React to leverage the power of both technologies, allowing developers to build high-quality hybrid apps.

### Rapid Development:
It offers a structured and organized project setup, enabling rapid development of feature-rich applications without the need to start from scratch.

### Enhanced User Experience:
The Starter Kit includes key components and features, such as state management, data fetching, and internationalization, to enhance the user experience and streamline development.

### Developer Experience (DX):
The kit is designed to enhance the developer experience by providing a set of best practices, tools, and configurations, along with an easy setup process, to boost productivity and maintainability.

### Testing and CI/CD:
It also focuses on developer tools, testing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring the reliability and quality of the developed applications.

With these compelling reasons, the Ionic React Starter Kit aims to empower developers to create modern, performant, and scalable hybrid applications with ease.

For further details, you can refer to the Starter Guide and start working with the kit on GitHub.
